Built a real-time Virtual Paint App using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe to allow users to draw in the air using hand gestures, without touching the screen or using a mouse. 
The app tracks hand movements through a webcam and maps fingertip positions to virtual drawing actions.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used:
Python 3.x

OpenCV â€“ For video capture and drawing

MediaPipe â€“ For detecting and tracking hand landmarks

NumPy â€“ For image processing and array manipulations
